            <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Visual Hierarchy is the arrangement or presentation of elements in a way that implies importance. It
                    guides the viewer's attention to key elements through the use of contrast, alignment, size, color,
                    and other visual cues.

                <p>
                    Scale is employed in an interesting way in this poster. The collage of cropped jazz instruments and
                    musicians is the major focal point. No image is more significant than the others, but when they are
                    strategically tiled together with space and color, they produce one enormous shot that acts as the
                    highest in the hierarchy.

            <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The Rule of Thirds is a principle that divides an image or layout into nine equal parts by two
                    equally spaced horizontal lines and two equally spaced vertical lines. Elements in a design are then
                    placed along these lines or at their intersections. This guideline helps to create balanced and
                    visually appealing compositions.

                    Amazon use nine even boxes with text and material from the top of their homepage to the middle of
                    the page. They have a horizontal broad box near the middle of the page for rotating, smaller
                    graphics. They then rotate one line of three even boxes with one line of the horizontal wide box
                    near the end of the page. After three more boxes and one line of horizontal box, you've reached the
                    end of their website.

            <h3>Whitespace and Clean Design</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    White space is the area of a design that is left empty or unmarked. Clean design
                    uses white space effectively to create a sense of clarity and simplicity.

                <p>
                    In this photo, Apple not only employs active whitespace deliberately to bring the user's eye to
                    key components down the page, but the corporation also uses passive whitespace to navigate the user
                    through the information without a hitch.
