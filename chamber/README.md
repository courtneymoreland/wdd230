# Overview

As part of my learning journey as a software engineer, I've created a web app named "LocalBizConnect Chamber of Commerce." This project is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based website, enriched with JSON for dynamic content. The goal is to simulate a chamber of commerce platform that connects local businesses, promotes community events, and provides valuable resources.

The motivation behind this software project is to gain hands-on experience in web development, strengthen my skills, and apply theoretical knowledge in a practical context.
